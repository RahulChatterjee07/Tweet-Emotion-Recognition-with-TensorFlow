# Tweet-Emotion-Recognition-with-TensorFlow

This is a multi class classification problem using a tweet emotion dataset to learn to recognize 6 different emotions ('sadness, 'surprise', 'love', 'anger', 'fear', 'joy) in tweets. A tokenizer is implemented in Tensorflow to perform padding and truncating sequences from tweets. The deep learning model includes Bidirectional long-short term memory(Bidirectional LSTM) and is also implemented in TensorFlow.
